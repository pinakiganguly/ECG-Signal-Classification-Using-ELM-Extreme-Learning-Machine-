# ECG-Signal-Classification-Using-ELM-Extreme-Learning-Machine-
1. I have classified the ECG signal using a deep learning technique called the Extreme Learning Machine. Here I have taken only 6 classes to train the model, they are N,L,R,V,A,/
2. The data of the ECG signal is acquired from the MIT-BIH dataset.
3. The main Extreme Learning Machine algorithm is written in elm.py
4. the location of your jupyter notebook and the elm pyhton file should be same
5. The whole data in the dataset was unbalanced, so to balance the data and for proper and efficient training and deployment of the model we used a sklearn module called the # resample
6. Made the train test split, trained the model and then predicted it accordingly.
7. Calculated th accuracy score and ploted the confusion matrix.
8. The whole jupyter notebook is hereby attached.
