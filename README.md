# ECG-Signal-Classification-Using-ELM-Extreme-Learning-Machine-
I have classified the ECG signal using a deep learning technique called the Extreme Learning Machine. Here I have taken only 6 classes to train the model, they are N,L,R,V,A,/
The data of the ECG signal is acquired from the MIT-BIH dataset.
The whole data in the dataset was unbalanced, so to balance the data and for proper and efficient training and deployment of the model we used a sklearn module called the # resample
Made the train test split, trained the model and then predicted it accordingly.
Calculated th accuracy score and ploted the confusion matrix.
The whole jupyter notebook is hereby attached.
